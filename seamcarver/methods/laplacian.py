"""
This module implements the Laplacian energy method for seam carving, providing
an energy map computation based on the Laplacian operator. The Laplacian
operator is widely used in image processing to detect regions of rapid
intensity change by calculating the second derivative at each pixel.

For more information, see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_of_Gaussian).
